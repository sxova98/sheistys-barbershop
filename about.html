                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Sheisty's Barbershop was founded in 2010 by lifelong friends with a shared passion for classic grooming and community spirit. What began as a single-chair shop on a quiet Johannesburg street quickly became a local favorite, known for its welcoming atmosphere and skilled barbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, Sheisty's has grown from humble beginnings into a vibrant hub where generations gather for more than just a haircut. Our team blends time-honored techniques with modern styles, ensuring every client leaves looking sharp and feeling confident. We take pride in supporting local events, mentoring young barbers, and giving back to the neighborhood that has supported us from day one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Sheisty's Barbershop stands as a symbol of tradition, quality, and community—a place where everyone is welcome, and every visit is a chance to connect.
